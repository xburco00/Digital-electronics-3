## Multiplexer - 2-bit wide 4-to-1 mux

### Listing of VHDL architecture from source file `mux_2bit_4to1.vhd` with syntax highlighting

```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of mux_2bit_4to1 is

begin
    
    f_O <= a_i when (sel_i ="00") else
           b_i when (sel_i ="01") else
           c_i when (sel_i ="10") else
           d_i when (sel_i ="11");

end Behavioral;
```

### Listing of VHDL stimulus process from testbench file `tb_mux_2bit_4to1.vhd` with syntax highlighting

```vhdl
p_stimulus : process
    begin
      
        report "Stimulus process started" severity note;
   
        s_d <= "00" ;s_c <="00"; s_b <= "00"; s_a <= "00";
        s_sel <= "00"; wait for 100 ns;
        
        s_d <= "11" ;s_c <="00"; s_b <= "01"; s_a <= "00";
        s_sel <= "10"; wait for 100 ns;
        
        s_d <= "00" ;s_c <="00"; s_b <= "11"; s_a <= "10";
        s_sel <= "11"; wait for 100 ns;
        
        s_d <= "10" ;s_c <="01"; s_b <= "11"; s_a <= "10";
        s_sel <= "01"; wait for 100 ns;
 
        report "Stimulus process finished" severity note;
        wait;
        
    end process p_stimulus;

end testbench;
```

#### After sucessful creation of your project you will get into this window

#### Now you must add/create testbench and design to your project, also constraints if needed
#### Steps for creating any of them are similar

## How to run simulation
#### After clicking `Run Behavioral Simulation`, program will start to process simulation (may take a moment), then new window with simulated waveforms, inputs and outputs will appear
